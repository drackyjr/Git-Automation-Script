# Git Automation Script

## Overview

The Git Automation Script is a professional Bash script designed to simplify and automate common Git workflows. This tool helps developers especially entry level manage branch creation, commit changes, and push updates to remote repositories with minimal manual input. It streamlines the most repetitive Git tasks into an efficient, error-resistant process, making Git version control more accessible and convenient.

| Branch Management | Automatically create and switch branches with validation |
| Automated Commit | Stage all changes and commit with a single command |
| Remote Push | Push changes to remote repositories, with optional force pushing |
| Verbose Mode | Provides detailed command output for transparency |
| Error Handling | Validates repo state, branch existence, and command success |
| Colored Terminal Output | Enhances clarity and user experience in the terminal |
| Usage Documentation | Built-in help guides for ease of use |

## Usage

### Basic Command Format

```bash
./git-automation.sh [OPTIONS] <branch_name> <commit_message>
```


### Available Options

| Option | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `-h`, `--help` | Display the help message |
| `-n`, `--new` | Create a new branch instead of switching |
| `-f`, `--force` | Force push changes to the remote |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Enable verbose output for detailed logs |

### Step-by-Step Usage Explanation

#### Step 1: Staging Changes (Automated)

- The script automatically stages *all* changes (`git add .`) before committing.
- This ensures every new, modified, or deleted file in the project directory is included.
- In verbose mode, you will see every file staged listed in the terminal.
- This removes the need for manual staging while committing.


#### Step 2: Committing Changes

- Commits all staged files with your provided commit message.
- Validates that your commit message is at least 3 characters to avoid empty commits.


#### Step 3: Branch Handling

- If you use the `-n` flag, the script creates a new branch and switches to it.
- If `-n` is omitted, it switches to the existing branch provided.
- It verifies if branches exist before switching or creating to prevent errors.


#### Step 4: Pushing to Remote

- Pushes your committed changes to the specified branch on your remote repository.
- The `-f` (force) flag pushes with `--force` to overwrite remote branch safely.
- If the branch is new to the remote, it sets the upstream automatically.


#### Step 5: Verbose Output (Optional)

- Use the `-v` flag to get detailed feedback on every step, including staging, committing, and pushing.
- Useful for debugging and understanding the script’s process.

## Deep Dive: The Staging Phase

Before the script commits your changes, it stages them all automatically. The **staging area** is where Git collects snapshots of your changes that will be recorded in the next commit.


| Aspect | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- |
| What is Staging? | A preparatory area where Git holds changes before they become part of the commit. |
| Purpose | Allows selective commits, cleaner project history, and a review point of the changes. |
| Automation | The script runs `git add .` automatically to stage *all* changes, removing manual steps. |
| Benefits | Saves time, prevents accidental omission of changes, and simplifies Git usage for beginners. |
| Considerations | May add undesired files if `.gitignore` isn't set; verbose mode shows staged files clearly. |

## Getting Started with Testing

1. Run the setup script to create a safe test repository:
```bash
./setup-test.sh
cd git-automation-test
```

2. Test your automation script:
```bash
cp ../git-automation.sh .
chmod +x git-automation.sh
./git-automation.sh -n feature/test "Implemented test feature"
```

3. Explore the demo:
```bash
cd ..
./demo.sh
```

## Troubleshooting and Tips

| Issue | Solution |
| :-- | :-- |
| Not in a Git repository | Run `git init` or navigate into a Git repo |
| Authentication failures | Setup SSH keys or Personal Access Token |
| No changes detected in commit | Confirm changes with `git status` and `.gitignore` |
| Wrong branch pushed | Use `-n` to create branches, verify branch names |
| Script permissions | Run `chmod +x git-automation.sh` |
